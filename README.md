**# 🐊 **PhishGator**  
### **Protect Your Credentials, Secure Your Web**  

PhishGator is an advanced, machine-learning-based system designed to detect and thwart password-stealing phishing attacks using innovative HTML template analysis  

---

##  **Features**  

- **🛡️ Dual-Layer Detection**  
  Combines phishing website identification with credential-theft analysis for enhanced security.  

- **🤖 Powered by Machine Learning**  
  Achieves **97% accuracy** using a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC).  

- **🔍 Comprehensive Feature Analysis**  
  Analyzes 32 URL and HTML-based features, such as:  
  - IP Address presence   
  - HTTPS usage   
  - Keylogging detection   

- **Advanced Reporting**  
  Categorizes websites as:  
  - Safe ✅  
  - Phishing 🚨  
  - Credential-Stealing ⚠️

##  **How It Works**  

1. **Feature Extraction**  
   PhishGator evaluates indicators like URL structure, form security, and script behaviors.  

2. **Machine Learning Classification**  
   Using Gradient Boosting, PhishGator distinguishes phishing threats with precision.  

3. **Credential Analysis**  
   Detects malicious scripts, insecure forms, and domain mismatches.

## 🧠 **Behind the Scenes**  

- **Dataset**  
  PhishGator is trained on the `phishing.csv` dataset with unseen URLs from PhishTank and OpenPhish.  

- **Model Performance**  
  - **Precision:** 95%  
  - **Recall:** 97%  
  - **F1-Score:** 96%  

- **Comparative Analysis**  
  Gradient Boosting outperforms Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models.
