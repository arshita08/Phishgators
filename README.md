## ✨ **Features**  

- **🛡️ Dual-Layer Detection**  
  Combines phishing website identification with credential-theft analysis for enhanced security.  

- **🤖 Powered by Machine Learning**  
  Achieves **97% accuracy** using a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC).  

- **🔍 Comprehensive Feature Analysis**  
  Analyzes 32 URL and HTML-based features, such as:  
  - IP Address presence 🌐  
  - HTTPS usage 🔒  
  - Keylogging detection 📝  

- **📈 Advanced Reporting**  
  Categorizes websites as:  
  - Safe ✅  
  - Phishing 🚨  
  - Credential-Stealing ⚠️

## 🧠 **Behind the Scenes**  

- **Dataset**  
  PhishGator is trained on the `phishing.csv` dataset with unseen URLs from PhishTank and OpenPhish.  

- **Model Performance**  
  - **Precision:** 95%  
  - **Recall:** 97%  
  - **F1-Score:** 96%  

- **Comparative Analysis**  
  Gradient Boosting outperforms Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models.
