### **Content Review & Policy Compliance System**  

PhishGator is a machine-learning–based Trust & Safety tool designed to review and classify web content for policy violations (phishing, credential theft, malicious behaviors). It protects users by ensuring content compliance and detecting unsafe websites.  

---

##  **Features**  

- **🛡️ Policy Compliance Enforcement**  
  Flags unsafe or malicious websites violating safe-browsing and security policies.  

- **🤖 Powered by Machine Learning**  
  Achieves **97% accuracy** using a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC).  

- **🔍 Content & Abuse Analysis**  
  Analyzes 32 URL and HTML-based features, such as:  
  - IP Address presence  
  - HTTPS usage  
  - Keylogging detection  

- **Trust & Safety Reporting**  
  Categorizes websites as:  
  - Safe ✅  
  - Phishing 🚨  
  - Credential-Stealing ⚠️  

---

##  **How It Works**  

1. **Feature Extraction**  
   Evaluates indicators like URL structure, form security, and script behaviors.  

2. **Machine Learning Classification**  
   Uses Gradient Boosting to identify phishing and abuse with precision.  

3. **Policy Violation Detection**  
   Detects malicious scripts, insecure forms, and domain mismatches.  

---

## 🎯 **Use Cases**  

- **Content Review Teams**  
  Support Trust & Safety analysts in reviewing suspicious web content at scale.  

- **App & Website Compliance**  
  Check developer submissions against policy requirements.  

- **User Protection**  
  Provide real-time alerts to prevent phishing attacks and policy violations.
